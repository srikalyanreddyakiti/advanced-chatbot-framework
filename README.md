# advanced-chatbot-framework
advanced-chatbot-framework is a modular, GPT-2-based chatbot system designed for building, training, and deploying intelligent conversational agents. It supports fine-tuning on custom datasets, interactive chat via command line, and text generation. Ideal for research, prototyping, or extending into production-ready AI assistants.

A modular GPT-2-based chatbot system for training, generating, and interacting with AI-driven conversations.

## Project Structure

```
├── buildmodel.py        # Builds and trains the GPT-2 model
├── chatter.py           # Chat interface to interact with the trained model
├── generate.py          # Generates text using the trained GPT-2 model
├── gpt-2.py             # Core GPT-2 model setup and architecture
```

## Features

- Fine-tunes GPT-2 on custom text data
- Command-line chatbot interface
- Modular design for training, inference, and interaction
- Clean text generation with contextual flow

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- transformers
- torch or tensorflow (depending on backend)
- numpy
- tqdm
- argparse

## Dataset

Use a plain `.txt` file with training data. One line = one sample. Place it anywhere and reference it via `--data_path`.
